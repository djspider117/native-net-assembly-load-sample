# About this sample

It was written to indicate how one could host a .NET runtime inside their application and call into it. This can be used to implement a scripting engine that works off of .NET in a game engine or a plugin system for a cross platform app.
The host is written in C++.

> Note: The demo game engine shown here is just for demonstration. It lacks many performance optimizations and architecture needed for a real engine. It's just there to add some complexity to show how we can interop your host app with the managed assemblies in .NET.
